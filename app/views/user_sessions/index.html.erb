      <h2>You will be relieved....</h2>
      <p>when you see our grocery list app, because it’s been designed for cookophobes. When you add recipes to the grocery list, you are only adding the ingredients that you don’t have in your fridge. This means that when you update your fridge, your grocery list gets automatically updated as well.</p>

      <h2>Fridge is easy to keep track of!</h2>
      <p>When you shop using the grocery list feature, Frecipe knows what you’ve bought, so Frecipe will know what you can cook. Just make sure you delete ingredients when you run out of them to fully enable Frecipe’s awesomeness.</p>

      <h2>Built for the lazy</h2>
      <p>If you hate cooking but you have to cook, whether it’s because you’re on a budget or because you would like to start eating healthy, you are just like me. I hate cooking because cooking is time consuming. Frecipe cuts down the time in half, if not more. If it made me enjoy cooking, it can make anyone enjoy cooking.</p>
